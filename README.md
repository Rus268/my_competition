# my_competition
This is a submission for the Final Coding Challenge For the Fundamental Programming in Python for RMIT University Vietnam

The program is an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm that reads data and performs simple operations. It is a student competition management program that runs base on the command line.

The program uses only sys and datetime packages thus should be able to run normally on most versions of python from 3.9 and above.

To start the program run the command line:  python my_competition.py <results_file> <challenges_files> <students_file>

A result file is required but the program can run without the other two challenges and students files. 

In the folder text, some txt files represent mock data that you can use to test out the program.

Issues that will need to be addressed:
- Some functions are still handling multiple responsibilities of processing and displaying the data. This will be addressed by separating it into smaller function
- The current program is still running on the terminal. This is not very user friendly so will need to be addressed with a UI of some sort (HTML & CSS)
- Class can be better organised for better flexibility. C
