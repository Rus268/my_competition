# my_competition
This is a submission for the Final Coding Challenge For the Fundamental Programming in Python for RMIT University Vietnam

The program is an Objec-Oriented Programming paradigm that read data and perform some simple operation. It is a student competition management program that run base on command line.

The program use only sys and datetime package thus should be able to run normally on most version of python from 3.9 and above.

To start the program run the command line:  python my_competition.py <results_file> <challenges_files> <students_file>

Result file is required but the program can run without the other two challenge and students files. 

In the folder text there is some txt files that represent mock data that you can use to test out the program.
